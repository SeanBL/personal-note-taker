## Description
 The purpose of this project was to build a note taking application using the backend to set up an API to connect the front end to a server. The user can use the terminal to connect the localhost to a specified port in order to run the application in the user's web browser. The motivation behind this project was to better understand how to connect the backend to the front end in web development. Furthermore, daily notes can be taken by the user for reminders on day to day activities. This project really helped solidify the function of backend web development. I now have a much stronger concept of how the front end relies on the backend to store data to a server as opposed to the browser's local storage. I also have a better understanding of how to connect the front end to the backend using a framework such as express.
